function c = linewrap(s, maxchars)
%LINEWRAP Separate a single string into multiple strings
%   C = LINEWRAP(S, MAXCHARS) separates a single string into multiple
%   strings by separating the input string, S, on word breaks.  S must be a
%   single-row char array. MAXCHARS is a nonnegative integer scalar
%   specifying the maximum length of the broken string.  C is a cell array
%   of strings.
%
%   C = LINEWRAP(S) is the same as C = LINEWRAP(S, 80).
%
%   Note: Words longer than MAXCHARS are not broken into separate lines.
%   This means that C may contain strings longer than MAXCHARS.
%
%   This implementation was inspired a blog posting about a Java line
%   wrapping function:
%   http://joust.kano.net/weblog/archives/000060.html
%   In particular, the regular expression used here is the one mentioned in
%   Jeremy Stein's comment.
%
%   Example
%       s = 'Image courtesy of Joe and Frank Hardy, MIT, 1993.'
%       c = linewrap(s, 40)
%
%   See also TEXTWRAP.
