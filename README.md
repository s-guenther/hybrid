HYBRID
======

HYBRID is a tool which dimensions a hybrid energy storage system consisting of
two different storages. It uses a strategy, which divides the load profile into
a base signal and a peak signal which is taken care of by a base storage or a
peak storage, respectively. The devision is simply a cut at a certain percentage
of peak power of the original load profile. Depending on the value of the cut,
various E/P ratios for peak and base storage occour, building a characteristic
hybridisation curve. The investigaion of these is subject to this toolbox.
