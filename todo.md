TODO
====

- project/auxiliary/op_strat_reload_dim.m needed now that decay_ode exists?
- refactor calc_hybrid_w_reload

Immediate Steps
---------------

Organisational Folder Structure
-------------------------------

- Add Requirements
- Update README
- Add docs, quickstart, scientific, source
- Add sample, test
- Add License
- Add shortcuts in \$PROJROOT


General scientific work
-----------------------

- even for a signal which does not show behavior where integral is zero, it can
  be interpreted as periodic, and within this period, an optimum for two
  storages can be found --> this should be the main path to follow for
  generalization afterwards
- optimize this signal for solar coverage - with optimization is meant: find
  analytical expression which does this guaranteed
- how can recent research activity used for phd? How to expand it correctly?
- How to set the course correctly with the first paper

- optimize operational strategy, since it leads to useless interstorage
  charging

- mark technology and economic optimal point, analyze results

- equivalent stress hypothesis <--> equivalant load hypothesis

- solid predimensioning tools, algorithms and theory that assist finding the
  right technologies, dimensions and control strategies. The results should
  have a value comparable to technical mechanics: Solid and sufficient for
  most applications, delivering good rule of thumbs, but more thorough
  investigations and simulations needed for details. Tools should provide
  results which are tangible for humans and general for all applications and
  not as abstract as generic optimizations.
