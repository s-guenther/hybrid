<ul>
<li><p>in this paper, a theoretical and analytical benchmark calculation is
 performed, which results in a maximum possible hybridisation</p></li>
<li><p>with hybridisation is meant&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>therefore, hybridisation diagram is proposed and integral hybridisation
 potential parameter is proposed/introduced</p></li>
<li><p>needs ideal storages, is applicaple to all arbitrary signals</p></li>
<li><p>an ideal single storage is always separable in 2 ideal hybrid storages</p></li>
<li><p>resulting achievable ratio of P/E ratios of the both is dependent on signal
 and marks a clear line of possible and impossible combinations</p></li>
<li><p>Since analytical, only acts as a predimensioning tool and first step of
 design process, more thorough investigations needed afterwards</p></li>
<li><p>General approach to choose storage combination and to characterize the
 potential for hybridisation</p></li>
<li><p>theory is technology, control strategy and topology free, providing a unified

<h3 id="1introductionandmotivation">1 Introduction and motivation</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>general bla bla, need for storages</p></li>
<li><p>storages expensive, best possible utilisation needed</p></li>
<li><p>better utilisation by combination/hybridisation</p></li>
<li><p>in studies, mostly focoused on specific applications and technology
 combinations</p></li>
<li><p>mainly sc and li-ion, and automobile or photovoltaik</p></li>
<li><p>rather specific goals, like investigating power electronics topologies or
 control strategies</p></li>
<li><p>no general top level view</p></li>
<li><p>While other theories/studies imply a favourable use of hybrid storage with a
 certain size and certain strategy and say, it is quantatively better for this
 application, this theory investigates the potential and helps finding a good
 combination, starting point</p></li>
<li><p>Hybrid storages are multivariable optimizations, where in other studies most
 of these variables are implicitely fixed or weighted with a cost function and
 somehow hidden. This way, these studies are hardly comparable and the design
 process is not generic.</p></li>
<li><p>Different aims of hybridisation, mostly costs, or lifetime extension by peak
 power cuts</p></li>
<li><p>focussing on dimensioning, control and topology combinded seems reasonable
 since they all interact one with another, yet it blures tho view for a
 comprehensive design</p></li>
<li><p>Dimensioning is only a consequence, not considered solely</p></li>
<li><p>therefore, aim of this paper: application, technology and control strategy
 free investigation of hybridisation potential, analytic which only focusses
 on theoretical possible dimensioning</p></li>
<li><p>aim is to split a theoretical e/p ratio in two other e/p ratio, which might
 be nearer to real ones</p></li>
<li><p>thorough description/presentation of idea in following 2nd chapter, 3rd
 chapter provides mathematical and modelling background. 4th is expansion to
 an economical formulation and adaption of the problem, or a mapping of
 theoretical results to specific, 5th is application to common problems in
 other studies, pulsed and nefz, 6th are some loosely gathered notes, 7th is

<h4 id="2.1ideaandaim">2.1 idea and aim</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>structure of description first, math later because: otherwise the whole
 purpose and value only expresses itself after several pages and may get lost
 in between</p></li>
<li><p>calculation and formal introduction is deferred to to next chapter, as well
 es prove and formal introduction of assumptions, for now, idea is presented
 to better follow math derivations in next chapter, and resulting insights</p></li>
<li><p>for a given arbitrary signal or load profile for one period, an ideal storage
 with power and energy (independent of soc), without losses can be easily
 calculated by determining min/max power and max of integral</p></li>
<li><p>to hybridize this storage, insert two storages - base and peak where base has
 a specific fraction of the single power, and peak the difference</p></li>
<li><p>hybridisation always leads to same dimension in power as single</p></li>
<li><p>with these powers, following verbal strategy is applied: charge only when
 neccessary, i.e. when input power exceeds the power of base (or soc_peak is
 not high enough in case of coming demand) and discharge whenever possible
 with as much as possible. This is the case for reloading mode; exception:
 synchronized mode: if tau_full is equal, switch to synchronize mode to
 prevent overcharging of base</p></li>
<li><p>this way, for a given ratio chi = base/total power, the total energy needed for
 peak becomes as small as possible</p></li>
<li><p>moreover, with this method, the addition of energy also equals single storages</p></li>
<li><p>doing this for various chi from 0..1 leads to distinct line</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2majorinsights">2.2 Major insights</h4>

<ul>
<li>THEOREM: with this, the single storage with E/P collapses into 2 other E/P
 ratios, which are spread as much as possible for given chi as long as
 overdimensioing is forbidden</li>
<li>also, a hybrid storage can never be smaller, or: 2 can never be better than</li>
<li>one, but within the limits always as good there is a distinct line separating</li>
<li>what works, and what does not work Leaving line leads to overdimensioning</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.3proposalshowingexplainingresultingdiagramcharacteristicparameters">2.3 Proposal Showing/Explaining resulting diagram, characteristic parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>as mentioned, the resulting tuples of base/peak with dependency on chi can be
 plotted in e/p diagram, like fig 1</p></li>
<li><p>fig 1 caption: Hybridisation curve in p/e diagram; note the two coordinate
 systems, where the first &#8216;normal&#8217; one represents base storage, and the second
 one is rotated by 180 deg and tranlated to the point of the single storage
 for peak. For given power cut chi, the base and peak storage sizes can be
 read in the according coordinate systems</p></li>
<li><p>figure shows 3 lines. dotted one is isochrone of ideal single storage.</p></li>
<li><p>at the end, a second coordiante system starts pointing in opposite diretions.
 this is peak coordinate system where dimensions of peak can be read, while
 the first is base coordinate system, where dims of base can be read</p></li>
<li><p>solid line marks for given chi the base/peak storage tuple which with a
 maximum spread in energy. this means the peak storage size is as small as
 possible to fullfill the requirements of the signal. a further reduction is
 not possible since there is a high power demand which can not be covered by
 base which has this energy when integrated</p></li>
<li><p>dashed line is similar, but this marks the border which is reachable, when
 power flow between storages is forbidden, this means, peak can only be
 charged, discharged from signal, not from base, or: peak cannot discharge its
 energy into base</p></li>
<li><p>a tuple of storages can be read as follows: choose a point at curve. this
 point implies a certain power cut chi and mark a p/e tuple of both base and
 peak in the corresponding co-system and can be read at the axis</p></li>
<li><p>e.g. like in this example, the cut chi=0.25 can be reached with base storage
 of p = &#8230;, e = &#8230;, read at left and low axis, and peak storage of p = &#8230;,
 e = &#8230;, read at top and right axis</p></li>
<li><p>dotted and solid, respectively dashed line, enclose an area Ia and Ib. all points
 within are base/peak tuples, which can satisfy the signal, all points outside
 in area IIa and IIb cannot be reached without violated the demand of not
 overdimension the hybrid system</p></li>
<li><p>top left corner visualizes the corresponding signal in time/p(t) diagram.
 Moreover integral values to characterize this signal, form and crest, are
 provided and a function definition.</p></li>
<li><p>below p(t) diagram, a few integral paramters describing hybridisation curve
 are provides. These are defined and explaind at end of subsection</p></li>
<li>can degenerate for some signals,

<ul>
<li>for rectangular signals, it becomes a straight line equivalent to single
 storage, since energy and power are always proportional and takeover of
 high power parts do not lead to reduction in energy</li>
<li>for sinus-like signals no recharging possible</li>
<li>for signal with dirac like impulse and infenitesimal base - curve
 degenerates to rotated L, maximum hybridisation</li>
<li>for signals with discrete power steps - discontinuities in hybridisation
 curve, respectively kink in curve</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>with this diagram alone, a visual representation of the hybridisation
 potential is given</p></li>
<li><p>can be expressed mathematical as integral and specific values</p></li>
<li>hybridisation factor H(chi) = (base(chi)/peak(chi))_(e/p)

<ul>
<li>aim: find set chi mapsto ep,eb,pp,pb in a way, that ep becomes minimal</li>
<li>two storages must take the same power as single storage for all times</li>
<li>it follows: hybrid system always has the same combined soc as single storage,
 and there must be a at least one point within period, where both storages are
 completely full</li>
<li>chellenge: find dimensions/pairing and control strategy in a way, that no
 storage &#8216;drops out&#8217; because its full, while power is still required</li>
</ul>

<p>Assumptions</p>

<ul>
<li>signal is periodic, &#8216;makes sense&#8217; and no hard restriction</li>
<li>storages are ideal with no losses and load = discharge power</li>
<li>storages are forced to take signal, no possibility to &#8216;dump&#8217; power</li>
<li>it follows: integral (energy) of one period is zero</li>
<li>integral at beginning, and therefore end of period is zero, can be always
 achieved by shifting signal</li>
</ul>

<p>Dimensioning</p>

<ul>
<li><p>power dimenioning simply: p_peak = 1-chi p; p_base = chi p</p></li>
<li><p>ensures that p_hybrid = p_single</p></li>
<li><p>peak storage must take all signal parts larger than p_base (or lower -p_base,
 respectively)</p></li>
<li><p>separate treatment of positive and negative load requirements to find minimum
 peak dimension</p></li>
<li><p>for this: switched decay ode = &#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>with build = ResSat fcn (with ResSat = &#8230;)</p></li>
<li><p>decay = &#8230;.</p></li>
<li><p>this is an ode which conditionally chooses if f_build or f_decay is being
 integrated; build and decay chosen in a way that: only positive integrating
 when needed and not more than needed; always negative integrating when
 possible with as much as possible as long as integral is larger zero</p></li>
<li><p>it is possible, that required energy for discharging event is larger than
 charging event, therefore: applying same ode to mirror(reverse(fcn))</p></li>
<li><p>the decay function has to possibilities: first one: power of base is
 incorporated, this means, peak can discharge into base, so a power flow
 between the storages can exist; second one: not allowed, peak must wait with
 discharge until the input signal becomes negative</p></li>
<li><p>the working sdode is visualized in fig 2</p></li>
<li><p>Fig 2 Example decay ode for determining minimal e_peak dimension w/ (top) and
 w/o (bottom) recharging for chi = 0.5; ResSat is applied to input signal p -
 if larger zero: positive integrate, if zero or lower: negative integrate
 decay; differences in w/ and w/o marked and commented</p></li>
<li><p>with this, e_peak determined by &#8230; max(sdode)</p></li>
<li><p>and e_base = single - peak</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Control
- The realization of the control is presented in blcok diagram, fig 3</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fig 3 control strategy block diagram; standard reloading mode which ensures a
 minimum usage of peak storage. Peak requests its discharging power, if it
 actually can, depends on current input power; Storages will switch to
 synchronized mode, when base is nearly full, to prevent dropping out</p></li>
<li><p>has a standard reloading mode and a synchronized mode depending on variables
 tau_peak and tau_base</p></li>
<li><p>assume we are in standard mode: it realizes the load when needed, discharge
 when possible strategy</p></li>
<li><p>peak requests to discharge if soc_aim = 0 and soc_peak greater 0, if it actually
 can discharge, depends on the input power</p></li>
<li><p>vice versa if aim = 1 and actual lower 1</p></li>
<li><p>soc_aim is controlled by future power/energy demands, which are known by the
 result of the backward integral previously calculated; if current soc_peak is
 going to drop below bw integral, it will switch its aim to 1 until its again
 larger. This means: future knowledge is needed for general signals; if the
 signal has a distinct charging and discharging period, without intermediate
 sign changes, the soc_aim change only becomes active when storage is full,
 and the future knowledge is not needed</p></li>
<li><p>this standard mode will make problems at the end when combined hybrid storage
 becomes fully charged. It will cause peak to discharge into base even if it
 is nearly full - then base is full and cannot provide power anymore,
 decreasing the power of the overall system, and a high power demand cannot be
 handled anymore. Therefore, the &#8216;time until storage is full&#8217; of both storages
 is evaluated, if base full will happen earlier than peak full, the control
 strategy switches to synchronized mode, where power is distributed evenly
 between storages, weighted by the ratio of individual powers (chi)</p></li>
<li><p>This control can be mathematically expressed by: &#8230;</p></li>
<li>fig 4 shows the individual phases for an example signal, it can be seen that:

<ul>
<li>at time .. peak must take the ResSat Signal. right at this time, it
 starts to request its discharging, but cannot and must wait until time
 ..; Later at time .. it switches to soc aim 1, because the bw integral
 signals an incomming discharge event and ensures, that peak has enough
 energy to provide the discharging power. at point .. base becomes nearly
 full and storage switches to discharging mode. at time .. storages switch
 back to reloading mode; at time .. again, peak needs to charge because of
 bw integral. It can be seen, there is a distinct moment, when both are
 full, and are empty at beginning and end</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Fig 4 Power distribution between storages for an example input signal. The
 individual states and phases of the currently active control strategy are
 marked</p></li>
<li><p>The control strategy will always work, but can lead to unneccessary
 charge/discharge events for peak.</p></li>
<li><p>This will be unwanted in reality, since it increases losses</p></li>
<li><p>strategy is not meant to be optimal, only to provide minimal instruction set
 to ensure theoretical working</p></li>
<li><p>It still works, when e_peak is dimensioned larger than needed (and base
 smaller by that amount). It will fall into synchronized mode earlier to
 balance the energies.</p></li>

<li><p>area within the hybridisation line and single storage isochrone give possible
 tuples of base/peak storages</p></li>
<li><p>in reality, only distinct technology lines are available limiting the choice</p></li>
<li><p>Which chi to choose depends on real e/p of available technologies (and signal)</p></li>
<li><p>for each chi, an optimal base/peak tuple can be determined, for some chi,
 multiple tuples (pareto front) can be found, for others only one.</p></li>
<li><p>there can be 1 point maximum, which does not lead to an overdimensioning in
 power or energy, otherwise to realize a chi within hybridisation area with
 concrete technologies, will most likely lead to overdimensioning</p></li>
<li><p>Fig 5: construction of minimal pairing for defined storage isochrones;
 pairing I: optimal chi_cross without overdimensioning; pairing IIa and IIb:
 optimal for chi lower chi_cross; overdimensining in power, pareto front;
 pairing III: optimal for chi greater chi_cross, overdimensioning in energy,
 no pareto front, single solution; pairing IV: if both isochrones outside:
 overdimensioning in both energy and power, no pareto, single optimal solution</p></li>
<li><p>explanation of fig 5</p></li>
<li>isochrones always have a intersection

<ul>
<li><p>within field: there exists a point without overdimensioning</p></li>
<li><p>overdimensiong in only one dimension (power when below crosspoint),
 energy when above cross point (only when crosspoint within</p></li>
<li><p>outside field: no chi without overdimensioning</p></li>
<li><p>below intersection and base is innermost line: &#8220;drive along at base&#8221; -
 find for one base size the corresponding peak size, this is where peak
 isochrone intersects with base storage rectangle. The found dimensioning
 can be operated for all chi at found vertical line between base an hybrid
 line or base and peak line (smaller one); which one to choose: p/pmax of
 both can be tuned; costs: take lowest chi; leads to overdimensiong in
 power</p></li>
<li><p>at intersection and intersection is within hybridisation area: optimal
 point from &#8220;dimension point of view&#8221;, no overdimensioning</p></li>
<li><p>above intersection and peak is innermost line: &#8220;drive along at peak&#8221; -
 find for one peak size the correspoinding base size, this is where base
 isochrone intersects with peak storage rectangle. Only one chi at which
 storage pair can be operated, but max depth of discharge can be tuned
 along all points between peak and base or peak and hybrid (smaller one);
 leads to overdimensioning in energy</p></li>
<li><p>hybrid line is innermost line: go horizontal to base to find minimum base
 for chi; go vertical to find peak to find minimum peak for chi;
 overdimensioning in both energy and power; not neccessarily worse area,
 in contrary, if intersection point is outside, optimum will be in this
 area</p></li>
<li><p>short: from innermost line: map to next base and peak</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>results of this construction can be represented in extension of fig 1, like
 shown in fig 6</p></li>
<li><p>for every power cut the dimensions of the best storages for given isochrones
 are plotted in overdimensioning diagram right next to hybridisation diagram;
 dims are normalized with single storage dim - show overdimensioning: right
 direction in energy, left direction in power</p></li>
<li><p>can be plotted for each pairing, but only the most interesting/smallest one
 is plotted for a given chi</p></li>
<li><p>a few things can be seen, as mentioned in construction in diagram above:
 below intersection (chi=x..y), power is overdimensioned, while energy is not,
 above: vice versa (chi=x..y); at chi=x..y where both curves are outside of
 hybridisation curve: both are overdimensioned, but nevertheless,
 added/overall becomes minimal</p></li>
<li><p>when costs are known, a cost(chi) diagram can also be plotted, again,
 dimensionless and normalized with minimal cost in right diagram. Note: with
 costs, the smallest pairing with respect do overdimensioning is not
 neccessarily the cheapest pairing, if this is not the case and the costs do
 not correspond to the dimensions in diagram left to it, the area is darkened.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Fig 6: Overdimensioning and cost curve; left diagram is original hybridisation
diagram; middle shows overdimensioning in power and energy dimension
(horizontal axis) depending on chi (vertical) axis and right diagram shows
costs with respect to chi. Both diagrams are normalized and dimensionless</p>

<h3 id="7conclusionandsummary">7 Conclusion and Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>paper introduces theoretical concept to calculate minimal set of storage
 pairings for a specific signal/problem in a sense that added power and energy
 of both storages always equals single storage and that for given power ratio,
 a maximum spread of energy content of both storages is achieved</li>
<li>For This a hybridisation diagram is proposed as well as integral
 hybridisation factors.</li>
<li>A the dimensioning approach is layed out and a control strategy provided,
 which will work for this dimensioning</li>
<li>The theory is expanded by an economical choosing strategy, if it will be
 applied to distinct storage technologies</li>
<li>This is applied to an nefz example, showing &#8230; new insight</li>
<li>Main drawback is the theory is its theoretical nature, needing ideal storages
 and an omniscient control strategy</li>
<li>But it can serve as a predimensioning and preselection tool, as well as
 signal potential analysis for hybridisation and a benchmarking result for
 comparision of real implementations.</li>
